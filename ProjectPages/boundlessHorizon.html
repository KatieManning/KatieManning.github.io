                <p>Third-person endless runner set on the moon. Players must dash through a lunar base before launching into a first-person sprint across the moon’s surface, dodging deranged astronauts to reach their ship.  Limitless Mode is a relentless test of precision, where the pace never stops rising and obstacles become increasingly unforgiving.</p>
                <p><br>This project was created for a module called Fundamentals of Game Development at university. The goal of this project was to build a playable vertical slice within a nine-week timeframe using UE5 and BPs.</p>

                <h4 class="mechanicHeading">UI</h4>
                <p>I designed and implemented menus, a leaderboard and score tracking elements, ensuring each element was clear and easy to understand for the player, while keeping the visuals consistent with the game’s aesthetic.</p>
                <img class="mechanicImages" src="../Images/BoundlessHorizon/BH2.png">
                <p>For the main menu, I used a generic button widget and assigned functionality as they were added to the menu, this allowed me to easily expand and make edits to the main menu, without remaking repeat elements.<br></p>

                
                <h4 class="mechanicHeading">Niagara Particle System</h4>
                <p>In this project, I expanded on my basic Niagara skills to create this cool fire effect for my comet obstacle! This allowed me to experiment with particle behaviour, colour gradients and lifetime settings, building a strong foundation for future VFX work.

 <h4 class="mechanicHeading">Object Spawner</h4>
                <p>Created a dynamic object spawner to manage obstacles and pickups.
    I used a column of spawners: each spawner generates objects at set intervals, with probabilities controlling how often each object appears. If an obstacle spawns, the chance of another appearing is temporarily lowered. Using a manager, limits can be set - such as a maximum of three obstacles in a column - to ensure no impassible walls are spawned. Spawn probabilities are also dynamically adjusted based on recently spawned items.

    </p>
                <img class="mechanicImages" src="../Images/BoundlessHorizon/BH3.png">
                <p>Below is a snippet of the spawner code. This determines which object will spawn based on probabilities and previously spawned items. Once it has selected an item, it speaks with the spawner manager to check that it is allowed to spawn it, before spawning the item and running a function to tweak the item weightings ready for the next spawn. To see this system in more detail, please see the technical video below.

                <h4 class="mechanicHeading">Background Art</h4>
                <p>I created the background art for the game using PowerPoint as it best suited the project requirements and my experience level. I used modular features, allowing me to quickly produce varied wall sections.</p>
